# Unsupervised Learning

This is part of MS Data Science Course at University of Colorado Boulder.

This is part of the unsupervised learning final project (as part of the Machine Learning UnSupervised Learning course). The notebook consists of EDA, Modeling results.

As part of this project, I have created a simple similarity based Recommendation System (Both User-User Similarity and Item-Item similarity) and deployed it using Streamlit.
